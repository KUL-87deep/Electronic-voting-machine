# Electronic-voting-machine
It's a 4 candidate based voting machine with delay timer simulated in proteus simulation software
It has two parts 1. the vote counter part
2. voting part
Vote counter: In vote counter the data of the voters will be processed as the machine delay end and after the processing through hardware it will show the final output as the winner
Voting part: It's a part with a button delay and a machine delay the data will keep store here in latch till the machine delay as the machine delay end it will processed to the Vote count part.
This is the simulation of the circuit that has done on proteous software.
